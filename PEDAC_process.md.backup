# The PEDAC Process

## P: Understanding the Problem

- Establish the rules/define the boundaries of the problem.
	+ Restate the pro
	+ Assess available information (inputs/outputs)
	+ Restating explicit requirements (rules)
	+ Identifying implicit requirements.(rules)
- Spend enough time here Don't rush this step.

**General Examples**

Given a string, produce a new string with every other word removed.

- Explicit requirements:
	+ Input: string
	+ Output: new string
	+ Remove every other word from input string.
	
- Questions:
	+ What do we mean by very other word? Odd? Even? Other?
	+ How do we define a word in this context?
		* more words are delimited by spaces.

## Example: Sum Even Number Rows

Imagine a sequence of consecutive even integers beginning with 2. The integers are grouped in rows, with the first row containing one integer, the second row two integers, the third row three integers, and so on. Given an integer representing the number of a particular row, return an integer representing the sum of all the integers in that row.
